## Backend Built Using

### Node.JS

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime that allows a developer to easily build fast and scalable network applications. We utilized Node.js throughout our backend because it gives us the ability to use easily modifyable and maintainable code.

### Express.JS

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js designed for building APIs. We utilized express.js throughout our backend to aid us in handling requests and creating effecient and scalable endpoints for our front end to use.



## Security 

For security we utilized FireBase Oauth to enable users to log into our app using their previously created Google, Twitter, or Email accounts. This then allows us to save user data in the cloud for easy access later on.



## Planning

After completing the TDD for our project we thought we had a good grasp of what we needed to create and how we were going to implement this code in order to complete the project in 5 weeks. This quickly proved to be false so we had to go back to the drawing board and come up with a detailed plan on how we would pull this off. After hours of planning we came up with a blueprint, which included what the migrations and state would look like on all components aswell and how we would pass props to populate them. There were a few times where we had to slightly tweak this plan due to unforseen circumstances but in the end our project came pretty close to the [original plan](https://github.com/labs12-call-complain/labs-call-back-BE/blob/master/README.md).
